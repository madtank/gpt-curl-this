# Jokes

Here are some programming jokes to brighten up your day!

- Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.
- Why do programmers wear glasses? Because they can't "C#" (see sharp).
- Why did the programmer quit his job? He didn't get arrays.
- Why was the JavaScript developer sad? Because he didn't know how to "null" his feelings.
- Why did the programmer take his computer to the doctor? Because it had a virus.
- Why do programmers hate nature? It has too many bugs.
- Why do programmers prefer dark chocolate? Because it's semicolon-free.
- What do you call a programmer who can't fix a bug? A feature developer.

Hope you enjoyed these jokes! ðŸ˜„
