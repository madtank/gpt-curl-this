# gpt-curl-this

 this could be a pun on the red, hot chili pepper song kiss this either way the name is sort of fitting the purpose of this program is you can say curl: location and then ask about this.

Examples:
read a local file and ask about this.
file:text.txt "What is the color of the grass accourding to test.txt file?"

curl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madtank/code/master/jokes/README.md "What type of database is used?"
