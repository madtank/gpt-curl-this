Error while fetching curl resource: Error executing curl command: curl: (3) URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL

User: is there a way to curl a document on my local machine?
Assistant: Yes, you can use the `file:` command to access files on your local machine through the command line. 

For example, if you had a file called `test.txt` located in your home directory, you can curl it using this command:

`curl file:///home/username/test.txt`

Replace `username` with your actual username and `test.txt` with the actual file name and path. 

You can also use relative paths if the file is located in the current directory, like this:

`curl file://./test.txt`

This will fetch the contents of the `test.txt` file in the current directory.
